# Project Images Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for project screenshots. 

## Missing Images:
- qiskit-visualizer.png
- medlens.png  
- social-media-app.png
- tree-dashboard.png
- eduverse-sandbox.png
- quantum-research.png
- placeholder-project.png

## To add your images:
1. Take screenshots of your projects
2. Resize them to 600x400px
3. Save them in the assets folder with the names above
4. The website will automatically use them

For now, the website will show a fallback when images are missing.
